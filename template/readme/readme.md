## Contribution Guide

### Issues

The issues are named after the feature or bug to be implemented. For example, "Add missing ID when fetching buses". It is important to assign a verb to the issues so everyone knows what to do.
Last, we add a bracket with a value to the issue title. This value tells how hard the issue to be worked on is.

In the case of bugs, the issue should be described as precisely as possible and, if necessary, even provided with a picture or video. This will make it easier to edit later.

If an issue is to be worked on, enter yourself as the _assignee_.

**Important**: You should only enter yourself as an _assignee_ if you also worked on the issue.

### Board

We use the Projects Board from GitHub as a board. This board is automated and requires little manual work.

### Labels

We use this [Guide][LABELS_GUIDE_URL] for the labels.

### Branching

We use this [GitFlow Guide][GITFLOW_GUIDE_URL] for branching and development cycle.

### Commits

The commits are given a meaningful name and description.
The description should say why this change was made and **not** how. The how can be read in the code.

If you are done with editing the issue, you have to add a keyword and the ID of the issue to close the issue.

Here is the [Guide][LINKING_ISSUE_TO_PULLREQUEST] from GitHub.

### Folder and file structure

We use this [Guide][FOLDER_AND_FILE_STRUCTURE_GUIDE_URL] for the structure and naming of files and folders.

### Best Practices

We use this [Guide][BEST_PRACTICES_GUIDE_URL] for the structure of classes and functions.
