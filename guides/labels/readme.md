# Github Labels

## How To Use Labels

For clarity, use only one of these labels! if you feel that you need to use more, your issue might not be specific enough:

* `#EE3F46` Problems (high priority): `bug` `security` `production`
* `#5EBEFF` Improvements (generally iteration on code): `enhancement` `optimization`
* `#91CA55` Additions (generally new code): `feature`
* `#CC317C` Feedback (some do not involve code): `discussion` `question` `community`
* `#FAD8C7` Testing (needs to be done or only occurs in): `test` `staging`
* `#FFC274` Experience (more artistic): `design` `ux`
* `#FEF2C0` Mindless (can be done during a break): `chore` `legal` `documentation`
* `#D2DAE1` Inactive (gets immediately closed): `invalid` `wontfix` `duplicate` `deprecated`

These can be attached to the ones above to give more context:

* `#BFD4F2` Platform (can exceptionally be customized to group issues): `server` `browser` `android` `ios` `web` 
* `#FBCA04` Pending (stalled by difficulty or external): `help wanted` `in progress` `on hold` `watchlist`
